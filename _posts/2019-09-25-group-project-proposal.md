**The problem**

In colleges, off-campus community are usually segregated from the student body. It is often hard to meet new people outside of this kind of structured environment. Organizations that currently organize activities that connect people in the communities are currently very systematic and community-service oriented. As a result, meetings that do happen between these two groups of people are usually task-driven when they occur. They do not involve spending time together and building a relationship.

**The motivation**

Our motivation is to bring people who have similar interests together. We want to provide services that bring people at a more personal level together. This way, the student can learn more about his/her community while at college. At the same time, an elderly citizen, people who live alone, can actively ask either for help or for company. For example, a lady who needs some person to walk her dog, or a college student looking for a place to stay on campus holidays, when the school is potentially closed.

**The solution**

Our main focus is to build relationships in the community around campus through fostering connections. There will be two main user groups, the hosts (usually older adults or people who need services), and the host-ees (usually students). An important aspect of community building and connecting is that it needs to be intentional, and this app helps ease the necessity of searching and reaching out for like-minded people. There are also currently multiple organizations that provide community services around campus areas. We want to implement this app both in website and phone app form. We feel like the website form would be easier to use for senior citizens, and the app would be more convenient for college-age students.

One of the challenges in implementing this app would be the necessity to maintain the safety and the inclusiveness of users. We can group people together based on their shared interests, or exclude people the hosts are not comfortable inviting in an event post. Asking users to provide some sort of identification (driver licenses), can also deter them from taking advantage of the system.

An extra feature worth adding is for people who need services and are willing to pay, or for students who want to work off-time. There can be a separate section dedicated to this purpose, but it should not be the main focus of our app.

There are also current alternatives for community connection currently offered at Williams. For example, the Daily Messages send out information about Thanksgiving stays in the campus community; when students respond, they will connect the students with the suitable hosts who sign up. We think the Daily Messages is confined within the Williams Community, and it is hard to get to know the hosts beforehand. Another alternative is the [Williams Switch Board](https://williams.switchboardhq.com/sign_up) website. However, we think the application is too focused in terms of actions (transactional or service providing) instead of fostering relationships.
