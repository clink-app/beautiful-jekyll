## **Problem and Solution Overview**

The problem we focus on is the difficulty surrounding finding ways to engage in community life. Our [CI review](https://clink-app.github.io/2019-10-02-CI_review/) showed us that three main pain points felt by those looking to engage in community activities and events (both on and off campus) are related to 1.) convenience, 2.) accessibility of information, and 3.) personalization. These three points are closely connected, as convenience largely includes the ease with which information can be attained and the degree to which the things you learn about are tailored to your interest. It also involves other difficulties, such as scheduling activities you’d want to do with others, and the tedious work of keeping track of which events you’re interested in. As a result of these findings, our solution focuses on mitigating these constraints. It will be in the form of a mobile app, and will provide the user with customizable, personalized information about events near them. The main purpose will be to increase the ease with which users can access and save information, and to limit the information they receive to a manageable amount. Events can be tagged to a physical location, so users can see on a map where events take place, or become aware of something they may not have known about otherwise. For users who want to do as little work as possible, the app will also be able to give recommendations about what events are a best match based on the user’s past selections and ratings. This means that with almost no effort on the part of the user (they do need to set up their preferences), they would still be able to get personally tailored event recommendations that fit their schedule.

## **[Digital Mockup](https://clink-app.github.io/2019-11-14-digital-mockup/)**

For our digital mockup, we are able to expand our prototype more and make the most realistic version of our product so far. We added some specific sections such as “my event list”, “report”, “rating” and “dislike” pages, as our testers were hoping they could interaction with this section of our prototype. Another imporant change we decided to add to our prototype is the greyed out area that says “begin typing” so it’s clear for users we’re expecting input.

For the first task, our current design have a clear find events section that the user can tap in and go to the event list that has been filtered according to their default interests. From here, we designed our “FILTER” button at the top of the page so it can easily be seen that the user can add in temporary filters if desired. After that, they can easily see the details and add the event to their event list.

For our second task, our home page also has a section that points to the recommended events page of our app, “recommended for you”. Here, in case the user is confused about the functionality of this session, there is a question mark sign that the user can tap in and get information about the purpose of this session. After that, they can choose to add a recommended event to their event list or refresh the page in order to get two new recommendations.


## **Discussion**
We found that updating our prototype after usability tests made it so that our later testers were more able to see different, unrelated issues. Maybe our earlier testers didn’t pick up on these things because they seemed more subtle compared to the things they did tell us, which we were then able to fix before the next test. This allowed us to uncover more problems. The iterative process was also valuable because there were several times (e.g. the filter menu) where our revisions were not as comprehensive as they needed to be, although we had thought while designing the changes that we had addressed the issues the tester identified. Another example of this is the phrasing for the recommendation button: we went from ‘rec me’ to ‘quick find’ to ‘recommended for me’, and even with this last wording, we found it advantageous to add an information button that the user could click to get a more complete explanation. We also discovered that some people were able to complete the tasks quicker and with less confusion than others, even when they were given the same information. Iterative testing allowed us to find these weak spots in our design that prevented parts of our user base from completing their tasks. Had we not done iterative testing, we could have missed these issues.

We found out through the process of usability testing that the testers have trouble understanding our filter and profile editing section. They were mostly confused about how to actually edit the profile and weren’t sure whether they could provide input at certain steps. As a result, we redesigned this section in a much more comprehensible way by marking clear areas that need input and moving some buttons up to the top (APPLY) so it’s more visible and clear the next step in completing their task. Our filter element went from a drop down editor into a full page with more comprehensive instructions and buttons. The most apparent problem we had during the process was our user having problem understanding the naming of finding recommended events (originally called “quick find”). We thought this naming was clear at the beginning, but since all three of our users pointed out this confusion, we decided to change it into “recommended for me”. Originally, we wanted to avoid this long name and use something short and fun, but through our iterative process, we discovered that our users didn’t understand our quirky names and that a more literal label would be most effective. An extra feature we also added to our digital mockup is the “My event list”, “Rating”, “Reporting”, and “Disliking” page. During the usability testing, our user testers kept clicking on buttons that led to these pages, which were not in our prototype originally due to not relating to completing the tasks. By adding them to our prototype, we think it helps give the user a more comprehensive view of what our product is doing behind the scenes to generate recommendations. Overall, our final design has a lot more “help” buttons where a user can click a button to get an explanation of the purpose of a page, and a lot of our interactive components were made more obviously interactable in appearance, either with grey text for text boxes or buttons with more descriptive labels. Many of our design elements went through several changes, each proven to be insufficient by the next usability test conducted. Our final product is a more comprehensible, informative app compared to the minimalist design we prototyped first.

Our tasks remain the same after the usability tests because we think they’re comprehensive enough to explore the two main functions of our product: Event searching/filtering, and event recommending. One main issue was that we found out after our first usability test the user tester was confused about whether they’ve completed the delegated task. We realized we needed to provided clearer differentiation between the tasks, and better explanations (through the design) of why one was different than the other and how they were each uniquely useful for different situations/goals.

More iterations could have been helpful for our design process, especially if we can do usability testing with our digital mockup. For our paper prototype, we were able to get comprehensive feedback on the main components of the design, but we did not focus on more subtle aspects at all. For example, color choice, icon/ text size, etc were never mentioned. Our user testers were much more focused on the core features and functionality. However, being able to test with more users and asking them more questions about these subtle details would help us further improve the user experience.
