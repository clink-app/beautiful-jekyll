**Our first usability test**

We conducted a usability test on Nov 6th with TN, a sophomore planning on majoring in CS at Williams. The test is carried out in Eco Cafe, since it is a convenient location for our tester. Phoebe took on the job as the Facilitator. She explained the task and asked TN to explain their thought process as they navigated through the app. Vy was the Computer. The provided tasks include

- You are a user of the Clink app with the fixed preferences set for art and music. Find and add a sports event to your event list.

- Look for the recommended event list and add one of these events to the event list.

TN was quick to figure out how to find and scroll through events. However, they had trouble identifying how the temporary filter page works. They also found it difficult to differentiate between “find events” and “quick find”.
As for the revisions, we would need to redesign the filter page so it’s easier to understand for the users. We would also need to rename the title “quick find” so it’s more reflective of the recommendation system we have in our app.


**Our cognitive walk through**

**Results from our first usability test**

**Negative**

**Incident 1**: Not sure what the difference between 'find events' and 'quick find' is.

TN revealed out loud that they could not tell what the difference between the two buttons was. They tried both options in their first task. They also used "find events" in their second task because they wanted to find an event, it was what "worked last time," they knew it held their preferences, and they assumed all the events shown would fit their schedule.

Severity of 3

**Incident 2**: Could not figure out how to edit the filter.

- TN clicked filter, saw that it only had tags for what we mentioned was already set as a preference in the profile, and assumed that was all it was, exiting from filter to try quick find instead. The next time TN entered the filters page they had a realization that the tags on the page had 'x's and could be removed. They revealed to us that they 'saw what was going on now' and that while they thought the filter could add tags, it can only remove tags. They did not see the text box for typing and adding a new tag to the filter.

- Severity of 4

**Incident 3**: Not intuitive to find home page.

![](/img/UT_issue_header.jpg)

- TN had trouble getting back to the home page and asked out loud how to get there. We gave a hint to guide them back to the home page: "What looks like it might take you back to the page you started on?" From there, TN clicked the header to go back to the home page.

Severity of 3

![](/img/revised_prototype_header.jpg)

We added a circle around the logo in the header to make it appear more clickable.

**Incident 4**: Thought profile icon was decorative.

- TN didn't click on the profile icon at first because they thought it was 'purely decorative'.

Severity of 1

![](/img/UT_profile_icon.jpg)

We made the icon more recognizable as a person by adding a smiley face to the figure.

**Incident 5**: Couldn't figure out how to edit the profile.

![](/img/revised_prototype_profile_editing.jpg)

TN got to the edit profile page but could not figure out how to make an edit. We gave the hint: "Does anything look like it can be removed?" TN then clicked on the 'x' next to the music tag. They saved the page and revealed that they were looking for some way to make a keyboard pop up or get suggestions of tags to add. We gave them another hint: "Try going back to what you were just doing." TN clicked edit again and tapped randomly on the page around the tags until they hit the text box and our computer revealed the keyboard.

Severity of 4

**Incident 6**: Did not 'apply' changes to filter

![](/img/revised_prototype_filter.jpg)

TN did not realize the filter was scrollable and so did not realize that the filter had an 'apply' and 'cancel' button. After making changes to the filter, TN clicked the 'x' at the top of the filter page to exit out of it, assuming that would automatically apply the new filter.

Severity of 3

**Positive**

**Incident 6**: Scrolled down list of events.

TN could tell that the list of events was scrollable and did so to find an event they liked.

**Incident 7**: Added event to event list.

TN had no issue with getting the the more detailed page of an event and adding it to the event list.

**Incident 8**: Figured out how to access the 'RATE, DISLIKE, REPORT' menu.

TN clicked on the drop down menu on an event out of curiosity. They could tell immeadiately what it was for and knew it didn't have anything to do with their task so they closed out of the drop down menu without an issue.

**Our current revised paper prototype**

**Our plan for our remaining usability tests**
For the remainder of our usability tests, we plan to target another Williams student with a (planned) major in the social sciences, and an older adult who is not in the college-student age range. These two users would be able to provide different points of view about the app other than TN, who is a relatively tech-savvy user.  We are also planning to have the users test our rating feature, in which, when they rate an attended event, will take note so as to recommend/not recommend it to them in the future. The current two tests, however, seem to be extensive enough to test all of the currently implemented parts of our prototype. We are still planning to have one member in the group taking on the role of a facilitator, and the other the Computer. Each team member will participate in at least 2 usability tests. As for new approaches, we would like to give a more detailed explanation of the given tasks before setting the users off to do them. It’s important to give them just enough information to understand their role and do the tasks, without giving away too much information.
