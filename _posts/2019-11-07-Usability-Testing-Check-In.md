**Our first usability test**

**Our cognitive walk through**

**Results from our first usability test**

Negative

-Not sure what the difference between 'find events' and 'quick find' is. TN revealed out loud that they could not tell what the difference between the two buttons was. They tried both options in their first task. They also used "find events" in their second task because they wanted to find an event, it was what "worked last time," they knew it held their preferences, and they assumed all the events shown would fit their schedule.

-Could not figure out how to edit the filter. TN clicked filter, saw that it only had tags for what we mentioned was already set as a preference in the profile, and assumed that was all it was, exiting from filter to try quick find instead. The next time TN entered the filters page they had a realization that the tags on the page had 'x's and could be removed. They revealed to us that they 'saw what was going on now' and that while they thought the filter could add tags, it can only remove tags. They did not see the text box for typing and adding a new tag to the filter.

-Not intuitive to find home page. TN had trouble getting back to the home page and asked out loud how to get there. We gave a hint to guide them back to the home page: "What looks like it might take you back to the page you started on?" From there, TN clicked the header to go back to the home page.

-Thought profile icon was decorative. TN didn't click on the profile icon at first because they thought it was 'purely decorative'.

-Couldn't figure out how to edit the profile without a hint. TN got to the edit profile page but could not figure out how to make an edit. We gave the hint: "Does anything look like it can be removed?" TN then clicked on the 'x' next to the music tag. They saved the page and revealed that they were looking for some way to make a keyboard pop up or get suggestions of tags to add. We gave them another hint: "Try going back to what you were just doing." TN clicked edit again and tapped randomly on the page around the tags until they hit the text box and our computer revealed the keyboard.

-Did not realize that the filter had an 'apply' and 'cancel' button. After making changes to the filter, TN clicked the 'x' at the top of the filter page to exit out of it.

Positive

-Scrolled down list of events. TN could tell that the list of events was scrollable and did so to find an event they liked.
image

-Added event to event list. TN had no issue with getting the the more detailed page of an event and adding it to the event list.
image

-Clicked on the drop down menu on an event out of curiosity. TN could tell immeadiately what it was for and knew it didn't have anything to do with their task so they closed out of the drop down menu without an issue.
