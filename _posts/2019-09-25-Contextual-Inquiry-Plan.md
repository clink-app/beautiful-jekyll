title: CONTEXTUAL INQUIRY PLAN
---

Our target audience is college students and the people that live in the communities around college towns. The contextual inquiry participants we plan to pursue are people that have already been building personal relationships between students and community members. Since there are several user groups that might be interested in our app, we hope to interview participants from each group. One target group is people that have already been in the process of facilitating a connection between students and community members. We will be reaching out to the Williams staff that organize the Thanksgiving on campus program, where students who cannot go home over Thanksgiving break are invited to the homes of Williamstown residents for a big holiday dinner, and observe how they go about organizing events of this nature in their office. We will also reach out to the families that have been involved in these meals to discuss the process of hosting students and observe how they volunteer their time. Additionally, we could interview a student or community member that is a regular at the Farmers' Market, a small hub for transactional student-community interactions. This interview can be conducted on Saturday, when the market is open, while the other two depend on when we get responses from our participants, most likely next week.

In another paragraph, describe how you will interact with your participants and your role as the “apprentice”.

Will you be observing their current behaviors?
Will you be interviewing them about recent behaviors?

Please be as specific as possible, providing potential examples of your observation focus or inquiry questions.
