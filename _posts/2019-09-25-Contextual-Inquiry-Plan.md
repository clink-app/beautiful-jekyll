title: CONTEXTUAL INQUIRY PLAN
---

Our target audience is college students and people that live around colleges.

Since there is no obvious "context" in which we can observe a student and a community member going through the process of connecting at the personal level, we will likely have to use interviews to gather most of our user data.
