title: Our Team Contract
---

**Preliminary information.**
Our team consists of Vy, Michaela, and Phoebe. Our meeting will be scheduled with Google Calendar and we keep in touch through Slack.

**Guiding Principles.**
We pledge to hold a full team meeting for each deliverable. At each team work session, at least two members will be present. While working together, we will consider all ideas brought up and listen and discuss them respectfully. Critiques are expected and welcome. We will hold each other accountable and should any concerns arise, we will bring up the issue immediately and settle it as soon as possible at our next meeting.

**Preliminary focus on purpose.**
Our team aims to design an app that facilitates forming relationships at the individual level between college students and the communities around the college town. Our app, Clink!, allows students and community members to post and respond to geotagged activities they are interested in sharing with each other.

**Dividing up the teamwork.**
Tasks will be delegated based on availability and on a volunteer basis. All members are dedicated and motivated and will hold each other and ourselves accountable for completing our fair share of work. Since this will be a learning experience for all of us, we will rotate which group roles we take on.

**Developing a team plan.**
Our team meets before every deliverable to discuss ideas and delegate tasks. Individual work is then done and then critiqued by the group before submission.

**Meeting Management.**
We will meet for an extended period of time at least once a week. We expect everyone to be at the meeting. As we are all busy, we will schedule this meeting, and any necessary follow-up meetings, through Slack.

**Accountability Processes.**
Accountability is kept with our constant access to communication through Slack. We share our work constantly with each other and ask to check others’ as well.

**Rewards and Punishments.**
Successes will be rewarded with satisfaction and a good night’s sleep. Failures will be punished with disappointment and no sleep. 

**Follow-Up.**
We will revisit our contract at after deliverable deadline to discuss whether the contract needs editing. During the discussion, members can bring up issues that are not covered by the contract and suggest solutions. If all members come to an agreement on an issue, the contract will be revised to reflect that.
