**Problem and Solution Overview**

The problem we focus on is the difficulty surrounding finding ways to engage in community life. Our [CI review](https://clink-app.github.io/2019-10-02-CI_review/) showed us that three main pain points felt by those looking to engage in community activities and events (both on and off campus) are related to 1.) convenience, 2.) accessibility of information, and 3.) personalization. These three points are closely connected, as convenience largely includes the ease with which information can be attained and the degree to which the things you learn about are tailored to your interest. It also involves other difficulties, such as scheduling activities you’d want to do with others, and the tedious work of keeping track of which events you’re interested in. As a result of these findings, our solution focuses on mitigating these constraints. It will be in the form of a mobile app, and will provide the user with customizable, personalized information about events near them. The main purpose will be to increase the ease with which users can access and save information, and to limit the information they receive to a manageable amount. Events can be tagged to a physical location, so users can see on a map where events take place, or become aware of something they may not have known about otherwise. For users who want to do as little work as possible, the app will also be able to give recommendations about what events are a best match based on the user’s past selections and ratings. This means that with almost no effort on the part of the user (they do need to set up their preferences), they would still be able to get personally tailored event recommendations that fit their schedule.


**Design Research Goals, Stakeholders, and Participants**

The goal of our design research was to learn more about the context surrounding our problem: what different parties were involved, and who could be helped by a solution? What were the things that contributed to the problem, and what solutions were there already? Where did people feel that there needed to be better solutions? The three main participants in our design research (described [here](https://clink-app.github.io/2019-10-02-CI_review/) in sections marked *process* and *research participants*) were NW, PC, and JM; each of these people came from different groups of stakeholders. PC is the director of CLiA, and works very closely with both community members wanting to attract students (and other community members) to their events and with students. She serves as a main point of connection between these groups, and so is aware of the difficulties each face. NW is a student at Williams who also works with CLiA’s communications office. They are exposed to many of the same stakeholders that PC is, but as a student, was able to provide more in-depth insight into the student perspective. JM works with the music department, and is in charge of publicizing events. Their audience includes both students and members of the broader community, and they’ve tried many different methods of publication to see what gets the best results from different groups. This perspective was helpful because he was able to speak about the challenges faced by those who want to learn about a very specific kind of event.


**Design Research Results and Themes**

The results from our design research included a number of key findings (described in part one, [here](https://clink-app.github.io/2019-10-02-CI_review/)), including:
- Important to encourage good fit between the events and those attending events
- There are many methods for sharing information that attracts different audience groups
- Activities with a variety of participation options are more attractive
- Time and availability are constraints; it’s hard to fit things into a schedule if they are not planned in advance
- Not knowing about events is a significant constraint
- Transportation is a constraint
- There are plenty of opportunities available on/off campus
- Personal connections, personalization, and convenience help people overcome constraints
- Participation can be encouraged with external perks
- Technology proves a significant barrier for many older Williamstown/local residents
We condensed these findings into three main themes, which established the direction we took to design a solution. The main themes, as described in our problem and solution overview, relate to the convenience, accessibility, and personalization of information. Our research showed that current information-gathering mechanisms left users frustrated along these lines and posed a significant barrier to finding ways to engage in community life. As a result, we focused our design around solving these problems.
