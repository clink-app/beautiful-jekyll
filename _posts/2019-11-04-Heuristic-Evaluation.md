| Heuristic Broken | Description                                                                                                                    | Severity |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Aesthetic        | Color Scheme, cute drawings, uncluttered                                                                                       | 0        |
| Freedom          | Interaction felt constrained, unable to respond to choices, give reviews, or dismiss items I don't like, report sketchy events | 2        |
| Real World       | wording confusing "rec me"                                                                                                     | 4        |
| Visibility       | Information felt relevent (location, description, etc.) | 0 |
| Felxibility | Simplicity comes with a cost; seems like experienced users may be overwhelmed by events (maybe a proversion that's more tailored?) | 1 |
