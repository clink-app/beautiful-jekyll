| # | Heuristic Broken         | Description                                              | Severity |
|---|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| 1 | Aesthetic        | Color Scheme, cute drawings, uncluttered                                                                                       | 0        |
| 2 | Freedom          | Interaction felt constrained, unable to respond to choices, give reviews, or dismiss items I don't like, report sketchy events | 1        |
| 3 | Real World       | wording confusing "rec me"                                                                                                     | 2        |
| 4 | Visibility       | Information felt relevent (location, description, etc.) | 0 |
| 5 | Felxibility | Simplicity comes with a cost; seems like experienced users may be overwhelmed by events (maybe a proversion that's more tailored?) | 1 |
| 6 | Control + Freedom        | Cannot click the profile icon                            | 2        |
| 7 | Visibility               | There is no indication that the scroll bar can be used   | 3        |
| 8 | Flexibility + Efficiency | Exiting filters: How to do it?                           | 3        |
| 9 | Consistency              | What do the colors associated with each event mean?      | 1        |
| 10 | Visibility               | What extra information appears when the event is clicked | 1        |
