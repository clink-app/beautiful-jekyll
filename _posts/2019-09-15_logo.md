title: Name and Logo Design

It was important to have a name and a logo that we felt reflected the overall focus of our project. We thought about what images or activities brought to mind shared experiences and new connections, and eventually came to the image of the clinking glasses. This reminds us of the 'cheers!' one might do with friends around a meal, but the simple cup design reflects the idea that this is not a special occasion, but rather, a more casual, friendly meeting. 

The name comes from the sound associated with tapping glasses in a toast, but can also be viewed as C-Link; while the connection isn't necessarily given to the user, we thought this was a fun reflection of our motivation: linking Campus and Community (two 'C's!).
