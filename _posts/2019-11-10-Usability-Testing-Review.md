# Our Tests

### Test 1

| problem          | severity         |
|------------------ | ------------------ |
| 1. Not clear whether filters will be applied when added  |  3  |
| 2. Not clear that user is meant to type in filters page  |  2  |
| 3. Not clear that header icons could be clicked          |  2  |


### Test 2

| problem          | severity         |
|------------------ | ------------------ |
| 1. Unsure about the difference between "apply" and "(x)" on filter menu  |  4  |
| 2. (Still) not clear that user is meant to type in filters page  |  2  |
| 3. meaning of "quick find" unclear        |  4  |
| 4. function of "rate" unclear-- how is it different from like/dislike?        |  3  |


### Test 3

| problem          | severity         |
|------------------ | ------------------ |
| 1. Meaning of "quick find" unclear  |  4  |
| 2. Would be helpful to have "events list" implemented  |  2  |

*Note: the change addressing problem two from the second user test (adding greyed out text signifying that the user can type) was implemented after user test 2, before user test 3.
